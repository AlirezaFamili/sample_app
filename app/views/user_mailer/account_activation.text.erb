Hi <%= @user.name %>,

Welcome to APPCO Twitter! Click on the link below to activate your account:

<!--Recalling that

edit_user_url(user)
produces a URL of the form

http://www.example.com/users/1/edit
the corresponding account activation link will look like this:

http://www.example.com/account_activations/q5lt38hQDc_959PVoo6b7A/edit

ALSOOOOO!!

In order to include the email as well, we need to use a query parameter, which in a URL appears as key-value pairs located after a question mark:

account_activations/q5lt38hQDc_959PVoo6b7A/edit?email=foo%40example.com
Notice that the ‘@’ in the email address appears as %40, i.e., it’s “escaped out” to guarantee a valid URL. The way to set a query parameter in Rails is to include a hash in the named route:

edit_account_activation_url(@user.activation_token, email: @user.email)
-->

<%= edit_account_activation_url(@user.activation_token, email: @user.email) %>
